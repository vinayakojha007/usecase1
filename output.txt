Here is a simple C program that calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int num1, num2, sum;

   printf("Enter number 1: ");
   scanf("%d", &num1);

   printf("Enter number 2: ");
   scanf("%d", &num2);

   sum = num1 + num2;

   printf("Sum = %d\n", sum);

   return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- The program first declares three variables `num1`, `num2`, and `sum` to store the two numbers entered by the user and their sum respectively.
- It then prompts the user to enter the first number using the `printf` function and stores the input in the `num1` variable using the `scanf` function.
- Similarly, it prompts the user to enter the second number and stores the input in the `num2` variable.
- The sum of the two numbers is calculated and stored in the `sum` variable.
- Finally, the program prints the sum using the `printf` function.
